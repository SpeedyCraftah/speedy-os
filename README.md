WIP

I had no idea what I was doing when I first started this project including 0 knowledge of assembly and little low-level programming knowledge, so this is quite an achievement?
Massive thank you to [OsDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) for the resources and community which helped me lots along the way.

## TODOS
